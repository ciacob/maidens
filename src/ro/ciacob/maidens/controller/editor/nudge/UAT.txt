CONSTRAINED NUDGING TESTS
=========================

Test Case #1: Constrained Nudging Availability
---------------------------------------------

PREPARE:
i. Open score "C Major scale.maid".

ii. Make sure Nudge mode is constrained (padlock icon is "filled").

TEST:
1. ACTION: Select the "G" cluster.
   EXPECTED: "Nudge element before" icon is disabled.
   RESULT: PASS

2. ACTION: Select the "F" cluster.
   EXPECTED: "Nudge element after" icon is disabled.
   RESULT: PASS

3.	ACTION: Select the "C#2" cluster.
	EXPECTED: both "Nudge element before" and "Nudge element after" icons are disabled.
	RESULT: PASS
   

Test Case #2: Constrained Nudging Operation,
Regular
---------------------------------------------
PREPARE: same as for #1.

TEST:
1.	ACTION: Select the "A" cluster.
	Click the "Nudge element before" button.
	EXPECTED: score should now be C-D-E-F|A-G-B-c|c#
	RESULT: PASS

2. ACTION: Select the "G" cluster.
   Click the "Nudge element after" button twice.
   EXPECTED: score should now be C-D-E-F|A-B-c- G|c#
   RESULT: PASS


Test Case #3: Constrained Nudging Operation,
Regular and Tuplet
---------------------------------------------

PREPARE:
i. Open score "C Major and G Major with tuplets.maid".

ii. Make sure Nudge mode is constrained (padlock icon is "filled").

TEST:
1.	ACTION: In measure 1, select the "E" Cluster. Click the
	"Nudge element after" button.
	EXPECTED: score should now be C-D-(F-F#-G#)-E, because the
	tuplet (F-F#-G#) should have moved "in block" towards 
	left.
	RESULT: PASS

2.	ACTION: In measure 2, select the "C5" Cluster. Click the 
	"Nudge element before" button.
	EXPECTED: score should now be [...measure 1...] G-A-C-(B-A#-B) [...measures 3 & 4], because the tuplet (B-A#-B) should have moved "in block" towards right.
	RESULT: PASS

3. 	ACTION: In measure 1, select the "F" cluster that opens 
	the tuplet (F-F#-G#). Click the "Nudge element before" button.
	EXPECTED: score should now be C-(F-F#-G#)-D-E, because,
	once "grabbed" by its left boundary and "pulled" towards left, the tuplet (F-F#-G#) should change places with the regular cluster "D".
	RESULT: PASS

4.	ACTION: In measure 3 (first measure of the second Section)
	select the cluster "G" that closes the the tuplet 
	(G-F#-G). Click the "Nudge element after" button.
	EXPECTED: score should now be A-(G-F#-G)-B-C, because, 
	once "grabbed" by its right boundary and "pulled" towards
	right, the tuplet (G-F#-G) should change places with the
	regular cluster "A".
	RESULT: PASS


Test Case #4: Constrained Nudging Operation,
Tuplet and Tuplet
---------------------------------------------

PREPARE:
i. Open score "C Major and G major with adjacent tuplets.maid".

ii. Make sure Nudge mode is constrained (padlock icon is "filled").

TEST:
1.	ACTION: in measure 3 (first measure of the second 
	Section) select the Cluster "G" that opens the second 
	tuplet, i.e., (G-F#-G). Click the "Nudge element before" 
	button.
	EXPECTED: score should now be (G-F#-G)(B-A#-B)-B-C, 
	because, once "grabbed" by its left boundary, the tuplet
	(G-F#-G) should exchange places with the tuplet (B-A#-B).
	REAULT: PASS

2.	ACTION: click "Undo [...]" in the "Edit" menu, or reload 
	score "C Major and G major with adjacent tuplets.maid" 
	while discarding changes.
	Then, in measure 3 (first measure of the second Section)
	select the Cluster "B" that closes the first tuplet, 
	i.e., (B-A#-B). Click the "Nudge element after" button.
	EXPECTED: score should now be (G-F#-G)(B-A#-B)-B-C, 
	because, once "grabbed" by its right boundary, the tuplet
	(B-A#-B) should exchange places with the tuplet (G-F#-G).
	RESULT: PASS


Test Case #5: Constrained Nudging Operation,
Inside Tuplet, Non-Root
---------------------------------------------
i. Open score "C Major and G Major with tuplets.maid".

ii. Make sure Nudge mode is constrained (padlock icon is "filled").

TEST:
1.	ACTION: 
	Select Cluster "F#" inside the tuplet (F-F#-G#), in the
	first Measure. Click the "Nudge element after" button.
	EXPECTED: score should now be C-D-E-(F-G#-F#), because 
	non-root tuplet Clusters "F#" and "G#" should have 
	exchanged their places within the tuplet.
	RESULT: PASS.

2.	ACTION:
	Select closing (rightmost) Cluster "B" in the tuplet 
	(B-A#-B) of the second Measure. Click the "Nudge element 
	before" button.
	EXPECTED: score should now be [...measure 1...] G-A-(B-B-A#)-C [...measures 3 & 4], because non-root 
	tuplet Clusters "B" and "A#" hould have exchanged their 
	places within the tuplet.
	RESULT: PASS.
