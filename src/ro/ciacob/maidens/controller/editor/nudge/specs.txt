Scenarios while "nudging":

1. NAME: SCENARIO_NUDGE_EMPTY
   DETAIL: "replacer" is missing (not found), which can happen in two conditions:
   (i) cross nudge (left or right) into an empty Measure/Voice ("empty" meaning it has no Clusters at all), or
   (ii) regular nudge right of the last Cluster of an underful Voice. 
   RESOLUTION: copy "mover" to the empty targetVoice.

2. NAME: SCENARIO_NUDGE_REGULAR [UAT covered]
   DETAIL: both "mover" and "replacer" are found and none of them is part of a tuplet.
   RESOLUTION: swap "mover" with "replacer".

3. both "mover" and "replacer" are found and only one of them is part of a tuplet.
   RESOLUTION: swap the one not being part of the tuplet with all the Clusters, in block, of the tuplet the other is part of.

   	3.1. NAME: SCENARIO_REGULAR_OVER_TUPLET [UAT covered]
   	DETAIL: both "mover" and "replacer" are found; "mover" IS NOT part of a tuplet, and "replacer" IS part of a tuplet.
   	RESOLUTION: swap "mover" with all the Clusters (in block) of the tuplet the "replacer" is part of.

   	3.2. NAME: SCENARIO_TUPLET_OVER_REGULAR [UAT covered]
   	DETAIL: both "mover" and "replacer" are found; "mover" IS part of a tuplet, and "replacer" IS NOT part of a tuplet.
   	RESOLUTION: swap all the Clusters (in block) of the tuplet the "mover" is part of with "replacer"

4. NAME: SCENARIO_TUPLET_OVER_TUPLET [UAT covered]
DETAIL: both "mover" and "replacer" are found, and each is part of a different tuplet, which can only happen if they live at the borders (first/last Cluster) of adjacent tuplets, be it tuplets that live in the same Measure, or in two adjacent Measures.
   RESOLUTION: swap, in block, all the Clusters of one tuplet with all the Clusters of the
   other.

5. NAME: SCENARIO_INSIDE_TUPLET_REGULAR [UAT covered]
DETAIL: both "mover" and "replacer" are found, they both are part of the same tuplet, and none of them is the tuplet root (i.e., the first Cluster of the tuplet, the one holding the tuplet definition).
   RESOLUTION: swap "mover" and "replacer" as usual.

6. both "mover" and "replacer" are found, they both are part of the same tuplet, and one of them is the tuplet root (the first Cluster of the tuplet, holding the tuplet definition).
   RESOLUTION: copy tuplet definition from the tuplet root Cluster to the other Cluster ("mover" or "replacer", whichever of them is NOT the tuplet root), and then swap them, as usual.

   6.1. NAME: SCENARIO_INSIDE_TUPLET_TO_ROOT
   DETAIL: both "mover" and "replacer" are found, and they both are part of the same tuplet; "replacer" is the tuplet root (the first Cluster of the tuplet, holding the tuplet definition).
   RESOLUTION: copy tuplet definition from "replacer" to "mover", then swap "mover" and "replacer" as usual.

   6.2. NAME: SCENARIO_INSIDE_TUPLET_FROM_ROOT
   DETAIL: both "mover" and "replacer" are found, and they both are part of the same tuplet; "mover" is the tuplet root (the first Cluster of the tuplet, holding the tuplet definition).
   RESOLUTION: copy tuplet definition from "mover" to "replacer", then swap "mover" and "replacer" as usual.
